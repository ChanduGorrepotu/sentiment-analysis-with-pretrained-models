This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using a pre-trained DistilBERT model fine-tuned on the SST-2 dataset. The model classifies input text into **positive** or **negative** sentiment.

## Features

- Uses Hugging Face Transformers library
- Simple Python script for sentiment classification
- No training required â€” uses a ready-to-use model

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `transformers` library
- `torch` (PyTorch) library


## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
